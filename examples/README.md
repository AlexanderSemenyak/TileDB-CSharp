# Examples

This directory contains several usage examples for the C# API. See [TileDB.Example](TileDB.Example) for a sample project building one of these files (`ExampleDenseArray.cs` by default). See [TileDB.ExampleAzure](TileDB.ExampleAzure) for a self-contained example which writes and reads an array on Azure Blob Storage (requires editing or environment variables for credentials).

These files are built and run as part of the [tests](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-CSharp/blob/main/test/TestExamples.cs).
